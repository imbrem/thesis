    This thesis is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done
    in collaboration except as declared in the preface and specified in the text. It is not
    substantially the same as any work that has already been submitted, or is being concurrently
    submitted, for any degree, diploma or other qualification at the University of Cambridge or any
    other University or similar institution except as declared in the preface and specified in the
    text. It does not exceed the prescribed word limit for the relevant Degree Committee.
